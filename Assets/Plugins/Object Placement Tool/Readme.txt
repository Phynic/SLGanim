Hi!
Thank you for choosing my assets!

You can find Object Placement Tool window under NOT_Lonely/Object Placement Tool

Object Placement Tool can help you to populate your worlds with many objects using just your mouse right click. Simply drag and drop prefabs in the window, add a random to rotation and scale, press Enter Edit Mode and start populating you scene using Ctrl + Right Mouse Button.
Also you can use Ctrl + Shift + R to quickly rotate selected object by 90 degrees around Y axis. It's very useful when you're building your level with modular pieces.

To clearly understand how to use all the features of Object Placement Tool, simply put your mouse cursor above the feature name in the Object Placement Tool window and you will see a tooltip.
